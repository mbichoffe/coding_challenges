"""Does a given string have balanced pairs of brackets?

Given a string, return True or False depending on whether the string
contains balanced (), {}, [], and/or <>.

Many of the same test cases from Balance Parens apply to the expanded
problem, with the caveat that they must check all types of brackets.

These are fine::

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("<ok>")
   True

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("<{ok}>")
   True

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("<[{(yay)}]>")
   True

These are invalid, since they have too many open brackets::

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("(Oops!){")
   False

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("{[[This has too many open square brackets.]}")
   False

These are invalid, as they close brackets that weren't open::

   >>> has_balanced_brackets(">")
   False

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("(This has {too many} ) closers. )")
   False

Here's a case where the number of brackets opened matches
the number closed, but in the wrong order::

    >>> has_balanced_brackets("<{Not Ok>}")
    False

If you receive a string with no brackets, consider it balanced::

   >>> has_balanced_brackets("No brackets here!")
   True
